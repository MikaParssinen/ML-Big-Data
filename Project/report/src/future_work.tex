\section{Future Work}
This study revealed several promising areas for future research and improvement.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Enhanced Feature Engineering:} Incorporating additional features such as detailed weather data, airport congestion metrics, and seasonal patterns could improve prediction accuracy, particularly for extreme delays.

\item \textbf{Advanced Modeling Techniques:} Exploring non-linear models or ensemble methods might better capture the complex relationships in flight delays, especially for longer delay predictions where the current models accuracy is worse.

\item \textbf{Real-time Prediction:} Developing a system for real-time delay prediction by incorporating live data feeds would increase the practical utility of the model for both airlines and passengers.

\end{itemize}
These improvements could enhance the model's practical applicability and provide more comprehensive insights into flight delay patterns and prevention strategies.
