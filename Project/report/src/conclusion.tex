\section{Conclusion}
This study has demonstrated the effectiveness of machine learning techniques in predicting flight delays using big data analytics. 
The linear regression model, implemented using Apache Spark, achieved high accuracy with an $R^2$ value of 0.9739 and RMSE of 17.45 minutes, providing reliable delay predictions for most scenarios. 
The analysis highlighted the critical role of departure delays and ground operations in determining total flight delays, while challenging some common assumptions about factors like flight distance.
The model's great performance in predicting shorter delays, combined with its decreased accuracy for extreme delays, suggests both the potential and limitations of current predictive approaches. 
These findings provide valuable insights for airlines and airport operators in identifying and addressing key delay factors, particularly in ground operations and departure scheduling.
While the model shows strong practical potential, opportunities remain for enhancement through additional features and advanced modeling techniques. 
The methodology and findings presented here establish a foundation for future work in flight delay prediction and management, contributing to the ongoing improvement of air travel efficiency and reliability.
